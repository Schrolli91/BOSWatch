#
# BOSWatch CSV file for describing POCSAG-Addresses
#
# For each RIC-Address you could set a description-text
# Use the structure: ric,"Description-Text"
#
# main RIC with subric:
# You can even define specific subrics, therefore you
# 1. need to specify a main RIC: 1234567, "Unit One"
# 2. specify a certain subric: 1234567B, "Subunit Bravo"
# The result for 1234567B will be "Unit One Subunit Bravo"
# - Be sure having defined the main RIC (step one)! -
#
# Only subric:
# Specify only the subric: 123457B, "Subunit Bravo"
# The result for 1234567B will be "Subunit Bravo"
# - main RIC is not required -
#
# !!! DO NOT delete the first line !!!
